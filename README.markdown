# JThumbor

JThumbor is a Java library that enables easy usage of secure Thumbor servers. For more information on what Thumbor is and why you might want to use this library, see the [Thumbor project](https://github.com/globocom/thumbor/wiki).

## How is the library licensed?

The library is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). 

## How do I use the library?

The library is typically deployed as a JAR file. The only class most users will need to concern themselves with is the ThumborServer.

### How do I get the JAR file?

You can either grab the release from GitHub's download button or compile it yourself. The only prerequisites are self-contained in the lib folder. I use Eclipse to build the release JARs; if you want an ant build file or something, you'll have to make it yourself.
